# my-modal
This script makes using modals as simple and fast as possible. You need to enter several necessary values and the magic will happen.The script can be used for different modal windows, configuring each window separately. It includes such necessary things as: fixing a bug with jumping content due to the disappearance of the scroll, popping up a modal window after a certain time (by default it is 60 seconds), as well as popping up a modal window when the end of the page is reached.

### HTML structure:

    <div class="popup">
        <div class="popup_dialog">
            <div class="popup_content">
                <button type="button" class="popup_close">&times;</button>
                
            </div>
        </div>
